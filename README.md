# Now

I’m living in Louisville, KY with my wife, Amber; our daughter, Grace; our dog, Widget; and our cat, Bagheera.

I’m still working in web development, primarily doing PHP and WordPress. My main gig is remote contracting for [Adjacent](https://weareadjacent.com), an agency in Syracuse, NY. I own a small gym for strength training at [Gus’s Barbell Club](https://gus.coach) mostly existing to let me have a personal space and help beginners get used to barbells.

Chess is my primary hobby. I achieved a new peak USCF rating of 1622 in December 2024 at the Kentucky Team Championship. Next tournament is the Cincinnati Open in April 2025. I follow the ChessDojo Training Program.
